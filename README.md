Code implemented in my Degree Final Project (TFG); Universidades de Santiago de Compostela (USC); Physics Degree. 

My Degree Final Project was titled 'Modelos de mercados financieros'. It
    recollects the major achievements in financial markets theory models through
    Bachelier to the calculation of price options by Black, Scholes and
    Merton.
    Here is a simple code made for illustrating the flaws of the standard
    model based in a Gaussian distribution in the price changes, but how it
    was a reasonable and realistic, so to speak, model with smaller time
    frames. It takes the stock prices of a company and realize various
    simulations and comparations, and also gives some statistics.
